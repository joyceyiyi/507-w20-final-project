This program aggregates crime data from https://spotcrime.com/mi/ann+arbor/daily and allows a user to select one or more crime types to see a graph of crime frequency by month. Data is displayed using HTML within a Flask App.

create_table.py is used to create tables in sql.
crawler.py crawls and scrapes data, preprocess the data and insert the data into the database.

Data File has been created so there's no need to run create_table.py and crawler.py

Run display.py to lauch the web.
